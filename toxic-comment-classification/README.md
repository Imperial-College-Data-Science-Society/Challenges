# Toxic Comment Classification

## Background

Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.

## Dataset

This dataset contains a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human rates for toxic behavior. 

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity such as:
- toxic
- severe_toxic
